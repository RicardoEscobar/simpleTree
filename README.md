simpleTree
==========

This project is an school assigment, it's purpose is for me to learn. I'm learning how to create and use data structures called 'trees'.

Hello world,

I’m asking for help, after scouring over the Internet for 4 days already I had found countless tree data structures examples and implementations, still I’m confused. I’m reading this book (Spanish): Estructuras de datos y algoritmos en Java (PDF) where I’m learning about tree data structures. I created a GitHub repository here: simpleTree. if you wish to help you can get the code from there. Below there is the Main.java at least the first version, id does nothing more than say hello at this point, but I’m going to update my progress on GitHub and on this post.
